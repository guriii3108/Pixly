## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Pixly follows a **"Sophisticated Minimalist"** design philosophy.

-   **Typography**: Clean, sans-serif fonts with generous tracking for a cinematic feel.
-   **Color Palette**: Deep Zinc (`zinc-950`) backgrounds with white text and subtle gradient accents.
-   **Motion**: Deliberate, smooth transitions (`ease-out`) rather than jumpy animations.
